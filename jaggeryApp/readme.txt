This jaggery app will serve as the UI of the email monitor.

How to use?

copy the emailMonitor directory located next to this file, into <WSO2_CEP_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps directory.
And start the WSO2 CEP server.
navigate to URL https://localhost:9443/emailMonitor/ using a web browser and you will be provided with a form to enter email credentials to analyse the email account.

Note:
Since this is the initial version of this UI this is not connected to the backend yet.
Therefore this will respond with a text output based on the user provided content.
